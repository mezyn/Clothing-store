# Clothing-store-project
This is the very first school project that I have developed with two other students in the study program during the DIT043: Object-oriented programming course.

The goal of the project is to develop a simple software for a clothing store. 
The software has basic functionalities such as user input handling, create a new item/review and find items/reviews with certain criteria. As the course aims to provide the students with a fundamental understanding of OOP, the most basic but rudimental OOP concepts can be found in the project, e.g:
- control flow,
- functions,
- references,
- encapsulation,
- collections,
- composition,
- inheritance,
- polymorphism,
- abstract classes and interface, and
- basic exception handling.

The project solely consists of back-end application; no GUI, front-end and database was used in the project. All process was made in runtime and all required data was saved temporarily in the arrays.
